## Definition

An $n$-dimensional *smooth manifold* $M$ is a [[Topology|topological space]] that is
 - paracompact (it has a locally finite cover)
 - Hausdorff (point-separable)
 - locally euclidean: For all $p \in M$ there is some neighborhood $U_p \ni p$ and a Map $f_p: U_p \to V_p$ to some open subset $V_p \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ that is [[Smooth Map|smooth]].

If $f_p$ is only $r$-times differentiable, we call $M$ a $C^r$-manifold. If $f_p$ is only continuous, we call $M$ a *topological manifold*.

## Properties
From paracompact it follows: An open subset of a manifold has at most countably many connected components.

Locally euclidean is equivalent to the existence of a smooth [[Atlas]].

[[lie-group]]s are manifolds.


## Examples
 - $\mathbb{R}^n$ itself
 - Product spaces of manifolds
 - $\mathbb{S}^1$
 - $n$-Tori
